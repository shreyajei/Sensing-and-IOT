# Structure 
1. Sensing: Arduino files (MPU 6050, flex sensor,)
2. Data Analysis: Arduino File (Serial Plotter), Python file (turns data into CSVs), Python file (scatter plot), Python file (graph for each CSV file with roll, pitch, flex, yaw values)
3. Machine learning: Binary Classification (Tensor Flow Model)
4. Actuation: Wifi communication between ESP32s and LED 
5.Visualisation: HTML, CSS and Javascript (3D visualisation of device moving in real time)
